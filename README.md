Our team is composed of the same members that were present during our project in ECSE 223, except for 1 (fly high James).

## Scope of Project

The scope of this project is to create a Sports Scheduling Web App which allows for the management of the sports classes taught in a Sports Center.
We have called this app SportsSchedulePlus, as a reference to AssetPlus, the app we designed in ECSE 223.

Our goals with this project are:
* develop a full stack application which satisfies all client requirements as well as more advanced bonus features.
* learn to use and manipulate data stored in SQL tables.
* create a dynamic and modern user experience using React.
* learn cool stuff along the way!

## Member Roles
The individual contributions of each member are clearly identified in the budget (see below).

In order to allow for all the members in our team to participate in every aspect of the project, we have decided to make the roles of the project flexible. This allows the members to pitch in whenever they have an interest about a certain feature, or technology.

However, to ensure a good flow in the project workload, we have decided to split the team into sub-groups for some of the tasks. These separations are detailed in each of the deliverables.

## Individual Efforts (Budget)
We have created a excel spreadsheet in order to visualize the hours every member of the team has put in for iteration 1, including which main tasks they worked on.\
